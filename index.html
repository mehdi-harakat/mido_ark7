							Ark7 Inc. ("Ark7") operates the ark7.com website (the “Site”) and
							the mobile application (the “App”). Ark7 serves as manager to Ark7
							Properties LLC and Ark7 Properties Plus LLC, and such companies
							shall be collectively referred to herein as “Ark7 Properties”.
							Neither Ark7 nor Ark7 Properties is a broker-dealer or an
							investment advisor. Dalmore Group LLC, a registered broker-dealer
							and member FINRA and SIPC, located at 525 Green Place, Woodmere,
							NY 11598, is the broker-dealer of record for Ark7, an issuer
							direct offering. Information on all FINRA-registered
							broker-dealers can be found on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.
						</p>

						<p>
							Investing in securities involves risks, and there is always the
							potential of losing money when you invest in securities. Past
							performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments such as
							those on the Ark7 platform are speculative and involve substantial
							risks to consider before investing, outlined in the respective
							offering materials and including, but not limited to, illiquidity,
							lack of diversification, and complete loss of capital. An
							investment in an offering constitutes only an investment in a
							particular series and not in Ark7 or any of the underlying
							asset(s). Investors should carefully review the risks located in
							the respective offering materials for a more comprehensive
							discussion of risks.
						</p>

            <p>
              You should speak with your financial advisor, accountant and/or
              attorney when evaluating any offering. Neither Ark7 nor Dalmore
              makes any recommendations or provides advice about investments, and
              no communication, through the Site, the App, or in any other medium,
              should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on
              or off this investment platform. The Site and/or the App may make
              forward-looking statements. You should not rely on these statements
              but should carefully evaluate the offering materials in assessing
              any investment opportunity, including the complete set of risk
              factors that are provided as part of the offering circular for your
              consideration. The applicable offering circular for Ark7 is
              available here.
            </p>

            <p>
              From time to time, Ark7 will seek to qualify additional series
              offerings of securities under regulation A. For offerings that have
              not yet been qualified, no money or other consideration is being
              solicited and, if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer
              to buy securities of a particular offering can be accepted, and no
              part of the purchase price can be received, until an offering
              statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
              "SEC") relating to that series has been qualified by the SEC. Any
              such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or
              commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of acceptance
              given after the date of qualification by the SEC. An indication of
              interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind
            </p>

            <p>
              Investment overviews contained on the Site and/or the App contain
              summaries of the purpose and the principal business terms of the
              investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for
              informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and
              each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed
              discussions contained in the applicable offering circular filed with
              the SEC. Ark7 does not offer refunds after an investment has been
              made. Please review the relevant offering materials and subscription
              documentation for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
              All securities (“Shares”) will be issued in electronic form only and
              will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange. We expect
              that after a series’ offering has concluded, the Public Private
              Execution Network Alternative Trading System, or PPEX ATS (the
              “Secondary Trading Platform”), which is registered with the SEC and
              operated by North Capital Private Securities Corporation (“North
              Capital”), will be a venue available for the resale of such Shares
              through Dalmore, as a broker-dealer member of the Secondary Trading
              Platform; provided, however, any such resale of Shares will be
              subject to federal and state securities laws and the restrictions in
              the series’ Operating Agreement, and there can be no assurance that
              an active market for any Shares will develop on the Secondary
              Trading Platform, that the Secondary Trading Platform will be
              available to allow resales of Shares to residents of all states, or
              that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available at all. For
              these reasons, investors must be prepared to hold their Shares
              indefinitely.
